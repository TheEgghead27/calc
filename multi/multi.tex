\section{Multivariable Functions and Space}
\subsection{Functions}
$$f: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m$$
Functions map a \textbf{domain} (e.g. $\mathbb{R}^n$, read "R N") to a \textbf{codomain} (e.g. $\mathbb{R}^m$ -- see section \ref{set-multiplication} for more information). In the scope of this course, we will usually have $n$ or $m = 1$, and $n,m \in \mathbb{N}$.\footnote{In generalized multivariable calculus, more profound matrix transformations are used.}
Common function domain/codomain pairings we consider are
\begin{itemize}
    \item $f: \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}$ -- can be represented as mapping points on the 2D plane to label values or as a 3D \textbf{surface}.
    \item $f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}^2$ -- can be represented as a parametric \textbf{curve}, with 1 time dimension and 2 space dimensions.
    \item $f: \mathbb{R}^3 \to \mathbb{R}$ -- can be represented as labelling each point in 3-space with a value (e.g. temperature).
    \item $f: \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^2$ -- can be considered a transformation in 2-space.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Representing N-space on Cartesian Axes}
A figure in N-space represents N values (from both the domain and codomain) per point. For instance, a number line represents 1-space, and the xy-plane represents 2-space.
\subsubsection{Axes}
For 3-space, we conventionally use 3 mutually perpendicular axes -- $x, y, z$, meeting at an origin $O(0,0,0)$ -- to represent the three dimensions. By convention, these axes follow the "right-hand rule", with the alternative "left-hand rule" leading to certain negations in formulae.
This does not extend quite that well to 4-space,\footnote{Most of us cannot visualize 4-space with 4 orthogonal axes. Please talk to your doctor if this is not the case...} but is also true of 2-space (though the RHR does not matter).
\paragraph{Sections}
Just as in 2-space there are 4 quadrants, in 3-space, there are 8 octants.
\subsubsection{Line Formulae}
These familiar formulae for 2D lines extend to 3D in intuitive ways.
\paragraph{Distance}
The 2D distance formula
$$d = \sqrt{(\Delta x)^2 + (\Delta y)^2}$$
generalizes readily into the 3D distance formula
$$d = \sqrt{(\Delta x)^2 + (\Delta y)^2 + (\Delta z)^2}$$
based on the Pythagorean Theorem.
\paragraph{Midpoint}
The formula for a midpoint on a 2D line between $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$
$$M\left(\frac{x_1+x_2}{2},\frac{y_1+y_2}{2}\right)$$
generalizes readily into the 3D midpoint formula for points $(x_1, y_1, z_2)$ and $(x_2, y_2, z_2)$
$$M\left(\frac{x_1+x_2}{2},\frac{y_1+y_2}{2}, \frac{z_1+z_2}{2}\right)$$
Alternative coordinate systems are possible, and will be discussed in a future section.
\paragraph{Partitioning}
The point P partitioning a line segment AB determined by points $A(x_1,y_1)$ and $B(x_2,y_2)$ into segments with lengths in the ratio $a:b$ has coordinates
$$P\left(x_1+\frac{a}{a+b}\left(x_1+x_2\right), y_1+\frac{a}{a+b}\left(y_1+y_2\right)\right) = P\left(\frac{ax_2 + bx_1}{a+b}, \frac{ay_2 + by_1}{a+b}\right)$$
Similarly, the point P partitioning AB in 3-space between $A(x_1, y_1, z_1)$ and $B(x_2, y_2, z_2)$ into segments with lengths in the ratio $a:b$ has coordinates
$$P\left(\frac{ax_2 + bx_1}{a+b}, \frac{ay_2 + by_1}{a+b}, \frac{az_2 + bz_1}{a+b}\right)$$
\subsubsection{Contours}
Contours allow for the construction of a $N$-dimensional representation/sampling of a $N+1$-dimensional function. For instance, contour surfaces are 3D samples of a 4D space.
We use contour curves\footnote{Although the textbook uses the term level curve interchangably it may be helpful to depict the "level" as the $z$-value in 3-space.} to represent a 3D surface with points $(x,y,z)$ using the curves in the $xy$-plane such that $z=c$, for some constant in the codomain. Below is a (low resolution) contour plot of the top half of a sphere:
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\begin{axis}
[
    title={Contour plot of $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1$},
    view={0}{90}
]
\addplot3[
    contour gnuplot={levels={1, 0.8, 0.6, 0.4, 0.2, 0}}
]
{sqrt(x^2+y^2)};
\end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
It is useful to have constant $\Delta z$ intervals so that the contours can visually represent the steepness of the surface.
\section{Notable 2D Figures}
\subsection{Lines}
\subsubsection{Standard Form} The set of points satisfying a linear equation of the form $$Ax + By + C = 0$$
Although there are 3 nominal coefficients, there are only 2 effective coefficients because (assuming at least one of $A,B$ is non-zero), we can divide by a coefficient, thus leaving 2 unknown ratios as coefficients. This explains why 2 points are sufficient to uniquely define a line, and distinct lines can only intersect at 1 point.
\subsubsection{Additional Equations}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Point-Slope: $y-y_1 = m(x-x_1)$
    \item Slope-Intercept: $y=mx+b$
    \item Slope Form: $m=\frac{y-y_1}{x-x_1}$
    \item Intercept Form: $\frac{x}{a} + \frac{y}{b} = 1$, axis intercepts at $(a, 0)$ and $(0, b)$
    \item Polar Form: $A\left(r\cos{\theta}\right)+B\left(r\sin{\theta}\right) + C = 0$
    \item Normal Form: $x\cos{\alpha} + y\cos{\beta} = d$, d is the length of the normal to the origin, $\alpha$ is the angle of the normal to the x-axis, $\beta$ is the angle of the normal to the y-axis
    \item Determinant Form: $\begin{vmatrix}
x & y & 1\\
x_1 & y_1 & 1 \\
x_2 & y_2 & 1
\end{vmatrix}= 0$
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Distance from a Point}
The distance to a line $Ax+By+C=0$ from point $(x_1, y_1)$ is
$$d=\frac{\left|Ax_1 + By_1 + C\right|}{\sqrt{a^2+b^2}}$$
\subsubsection{Area of a Triangle in 2-space}
Given points $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), (x_3, y_3)$, the area of the triangle formed by these points is
$$A = \frac{1}{2}\begin{vmatrix}
    x_1 & y_1 & 1 \\
    x_2 & y_2 & 1 \\
    x_3 & y_3 & 1 \\
\end{vmatrix} = \frac{1}{2}\left|(x_1-x_2)(y_2-y_3) - (x_2 - x_3)(y_1 - y_2)\right|$$
The latter form can be derived using the distance from a point formula. See \ref{determinant} for more information about the former form.
This is also known as the shoelace formula, because it can be represented as taking the points in order (clockwise/counterclockwise) and "lacing" the coordinates to form equivalent products.
\subsubsection{Projection}
The projection of a line segment with slope $m$ and length $l$ onto the $x$-axis is
$$\Delta x = l\sqrt{\frac{1}{1+m^2}}$$
\subsubsection{Angle Between Lines}
For two intersecting lines with slopes $m_1$ and $m_2$, $m_1 < m_2$ the angle between the two can be found by $$\arctan{m_2} - \arctan{m_1} = \theta$$
\subsection{Conic Sections}
\paragraph{General Equation} The set of points satisfying a degree 2 equation of the form $$Ax^2+By^2 + Cxy + Dx + Ey + F =0$$
There are 6 nominal coefficients and 5 effective coefficients. This explains why 5 points are sufficient to uniquely define a conic section, and distinct conic sections can intersect at a maximum of 4 points.
\subsection{Cubics}
\paragraph{Standard Form} The set of points satisfying a degree 3 equation of the form $$Ax^3 + By^3 + Cx^2y + Dxy^2 + Ex^2 + Fy^2 + Gxy + Hx + Jy + K = 0$$
There are 10 nominal coefficients and 9 effective coefficients. However, distinct conics can intersect at more than 8 points. This is known as the Euler-Cramer Paradox.
\subsubsection{The Euler-Cramer Paradox}
For polynomials of degree $\ge 3$, Because the system of intersection points may contain rows that are \textbf{not} linearly independent, it is possible that that the determinant of the matrix would be $0$: there is not a unique solution curve for the system. See \ref{determinant} for more information.
\section{Determinants} \label{determinant}
A \textbf{matrix} is a rectangular array of numbers.\footnote{Tensors can be considered a generalization of matrices to higher dimensions.} The dimensions are denoted $N \times M$, with $N$ being the number of rows, and $M$ being the number of columns. By convention, matrix variables are denoted with capital letters. Matrix elements can be addressed with subscripts $a_{n,m}$, with the comma delimiter being optional.
$$A = \begin{bmatrix}
 a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13} & \cdots & a_{1m} \\
 a_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23} & \cdots & a_{2m} \\
 \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\
 a_{n1} & a_{n2} & a_{n3} & \cdots & a_{nm} \\
\end{bmatrix}$$
A \textbf{determinant} is a function that maps a real number to every \textbf{square} matrix.
The determinant of a $1\times1$ matrix $\left[a\right]$ is the scalar $a$, and the determinant of a $2\times2$ matrix $\left[\begin{smallmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{smallmatrix}\right]$ is $ad - bc$.
\subsection{Recursive (Cofactor) Definition}
Given an element $a_{ij}$ of matrix $A$, the corresponding minor $M_{ij}$ is the determinant obtained by deleting row $i$ and column $j$ of matrix A.
The cofactor (co-factor) of $a_{ij}$ is $$C_{ij} = (-1)^{i+j}M_{ij}$$
The determinant of matrix A is $$\det{A} = \sum_{j=1}^n a_{ij}C_{ij} = \sum_{i=1}^m a_{ij}C_{ij}$$ given a fixed value for $i$ (selecting a row) or $j$ (selecting a column) respectively.
To perform this by hand, one can take an arbitrary row/column\footnote{It is usually helpful to select a row/column with values of $0$ or $1$ to minimize needed calculations.} and then take the minors of each element in that row/column, multiplying against the sign of the cofactor. Note that the sign of the cofactor alternates in a pattern like so:
$$\begin{bmatrix}
    + & - & + & - & \cdots \\
    - & + & - & + & \cdots \\
    + & - & + & - & \cdots \\
    \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\
\end{bmatrix}$$
\subsection{Explicit Definition}
This definition is listed as a fun aside; it is useful for proving determinant properties for the general case.
For the set of all permutations $S_n$, with the signature function $\sgn(\sigma)$ denoting $(-1)^n$, with $n$ being the number of transpositions (element swaps) from the original ordering of elements to get the permutation $\sigma(i)$:
$$\det{A} = \sum_{\sigma \in S_n} \sgn{\sigma} \prod_{i=1}^n a_{i,\sigma(i)}$$
\subsection{Determinant Properties}
Note that many of these properties do not have standard names.
The sum property (\ref{det-sum}), combined with the switching property (\ref{det-switch}), are sometimes referred to as the \textbf{multilinearity} of determinants in columns/rows.
\subsubsection{Scalar Multiple Property}
If any row or column is multiplied by a constant $k$, the determinant value gets multiplied by $k$.
\paragraph{Proof} Consider the recursive determinant sum for the new matrix, using the row/column that was multiplied. $k$ can be factored out of the entire sum, leaving the original determinant sum multiplied by the scalar $k$.
\subsubsection{Sum Property} \label{det-sum}
If all the elements of a row or column are expressed as a summation of two or more addends, then the determinant can be broken down as a sum of corresponding smaller elements.
$$
    \begin{vmatrix}
        a_{11} + b_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13} \\
        a_{21} + b_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23} \\
        a_{31} + b_{31} & a_{32} & a_{33} \\
    \end{vmatrix}
    =
    \begin{vmatrix}
        a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13} \\
        a_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23} \\
        a_{31} & a_{32} & a_{33} \\
    \end{vmatrix}
    +
    \begin{vmatrix}
        b_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13} \\
        b_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23} \\
        b_{31} & a_{32} & a_{33} \\
    \end{vmatrix}
$$
This property can be applied multiple times to separate rows.
\paragraph{Proof} Consider the explicit definition of the determinant. Choosing $i$ or $j$ to target the addends' row/column, we can use the distributive property to split the product into two, which represent the determinant of the separate matrices.
\subsubsection{Switching Property} \label{det-switch}
If we interchange any two rows/columns of the determinant, the determinant is multiplied by $-1$.
\subsubsection{Sum of Rows Property} \label{det-sum-rows}
Let $A$ be an $n\times n$ matrix and let B be a matrix which results from adding a multiple of a row/column to another row/column. Then $\det{A} = \det{B}$.
\subsubsection{Zero Property}\label{det-zero}
The determinant of a matrix with a row/column of zeroes is $0$.
\paragraph{Proof} Consider the recursive definition of the determinant. Choosing the row with $0$s will lead to $a_{ij}$ always being $0$, so the final sum is 0.
This property allows us to show that since the determinant form of a line results in an expression of the form $Ax+By+C=0$, and that the two points $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ satisfy this equation, the two points definitively show that the solutions to the equation form the line.
\subsubsection{Identical Column Zero Property}
If a (square) matrix has two identical rows/columns (or rows that are a linear combination of others), then its determinant is zero.
\paragraph{Proof} Using the sum of rows property (\ref{det-sum-rows}), we can manipulate the matrix such that the row is only $0$s, thus allowing us to apply the zero property (\ref{det-zero}).\footnote{Although not mentioned in class, the determinant of a transposed matrix is equal to the original matrix, making this applicable to columns too.}
\subsubsection{Dimensional Analysis of Determinants}
In the case of the determinant representing a triangle's area, we can translate and rotate the triangle -- since these are rigid motions, area is preserved -- making a new figure with coordinates that form a matrix with the following determinant
$$\begin{vmatrix}
    0 & 0 & 1 \\
    x_1' & 0 & 1 \\
    x_2' & y_2' & 1 \\
\end{vmatrix} = x_1'y_2'$$
where $x_1'$ represents the base length (rotated onto the x-axis), and $y_2'$ represents the height (rotated to be parallel to the y-axis). This determinant represents area (square distance units).

\subsubsection{Cartesian Products} \label{set-multiplication}
For sets $A, B$, their Cartesian product is $$A \times B = \left\{ (a,b) | a \in A, b \in B\right\}$$
This produces a set of (ordered) 2-tuples/vectors.
The "$n$-ary Cartesian product" generalizes this process to produce N-tuples/vectors, leading to a definition for "exponentiating" sets, as in $\mathbb{R}^n$.
