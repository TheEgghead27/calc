\section{Integration Techniques}
\subsection{Trig Integrals}

$$ \frac{d}{dx} asin(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} + C $$
$$ \frac{d}{dx} atan(x) = \frac{1}{1 + x^2} + C $$

\section{Indeterminate Forms - 6.8}
Limits of the form $\frac{0}{0}$ or $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$. These do not indicate the true value of the limit.

As a reminder:
$$\lim_{x \to 0^+} \frac{1}{x} = + \infty$$
is a valid limit, but it is invalid to write $$\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{1}{x}$$

\subsection{L'Hôpital's Rule}
Suppose $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are differentiable and that $g'(x) \ne 0$ around a. If $\lim_{x\to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}$ produces the indeterminate form $\frac{0}{0}$ or $\frac{\pm \infty}{\pm \infty}$, then $$\lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}$$ provided that the limit on the right exists or is equal to $\pm \infty$.

For L'Hôpital's Rule to apply, we must have a \emph{ratio} of functions, and in a true indeterminate form.

\subsubsection{Pseudo-proof}
Suppose $f$, $g$ are differentiable, and $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = lim_{x \to a} g(x) = 0$. Recall, by linearization, we approximate $f$ around $a$ as $f(x) \approx f(a) + (x-a)f'(a)$. Consider that                                                                                              

\begin{align*}
   \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} & \approx \frac{f(a) + (x-a)f'(a)}{g(a) + (x-a)g'(a)} \\
                     & \approx \frac{0 + (x-a)f'(a)}{0 + (x-a)g'(a)} \\
                     &       = \frac{f'(a)}{g'(a)}
\end{align*}

\subsection{Improper Integrals - 7.8}
An improper integral is an integral with an infinite limit of integration, or there exists a finite number of discontinuities between the limits of integration.

Note that this integral may not exist, in which case it diverges (usually to $\pm \infty$). If the limit exists, then the integral converges.

Example/Definition:
$$\int_{1}^{\infty} e^{-x} dx = \lim_{b \to \infty} \int_{1}^{b} e^{-x} dx $$

We must also use an improper integral bound limit to account for discontinuities:
$$\int_{-1}^{1} \frac{1}{x^2} = \lim_{b \to 0} \int_{-1}^{b} \frac{1}{x^2} + \lim_{d \to 0} \int_{d}^{1} \frac{1}{x^2} $$

\subsubsection{Some Ideas to be Wary Of}
These are reasonable statements about improper integrals with a bound of $\infty$, but they are not accurate.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The area accumulates forever, thus it is infinite.
    \item The region is unbounded, thus its area is infinite.
    \item \st{Just because the rate of accumulation (accumulated area) decreases, that does not guarantee that the total area is finite.} Beware $\frac{1}{x}$.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Bounding Argument to Provide Convergence/Divergence}
If $0 \le f(x) \le g(x)$ then $$\int_{1}^{\infty} f(x) dx \le \int_{1}^{\infty} g(x) dx$$.

Suppose you want to show that $f(x)$ converges. If you can find a $f(x) \ge f(x)$ that converges, then $f(x)$ converges. (A similar argument can be used to prove $g(x)$ diverges.)

\section{Area/Volume (BC)}
\subsection{Area Between Two Curves - 5.1}
If $f$ and $g$ are continuous on $[a,b]$ with $f(x) \ge g(x)$ for $x \in [a,b]$, then the area between $f$ and $g$ from $a$ to $b$ is $$\int_{a}^{b} (f-g)dx$$ (or $\int_{a}^{b} |f-g| dx$).

This can also be interpreted geometrically as the integral of the vertical difference between $f$ and $g$.

\subsection{Solids of Revolution - 5.2}
Solids with axial symmetry about an axis of revolution.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Sketch the solid formed by revolving a region $R$ about an axis.
    \item Suggest a method for computing the volume of the solid.
\end{enumerate}

Do be mindful of the fact that $V \propto Ar$, the radius (distance from axis of rotation) matters.

\subsubsection{Disk/Washer Method}
Integrates parallel to the axis of rotation. May be inconvenient, if not impossible, when finding an inverse function for $x$ in terms of $y$ is necessary.

Based on a Riemann Sum of small disks $\pi r^2h$ becoming $$\lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \pi(f(x_i)^2)\Delta x_i$$

Washers are merely the difference in area between a large disk and a concentric small disk.

Let $f(x)$ be the function producing the curve underneath which the region $R$ is bounded by (with the other bounding sides being $x = a$, $x = b$, and $g(x)$). Additionally, let $g(x)$ be the bottom bound curve function. It is possible that $g(x) = 0$ (bottom bound is simply the x-axis). In this case, we are revolving about the x-axis.

$$V = \pi \int_{a}^{b} (f(x)^2) dx$$
$$V = \pi \int_{a}^{b} (f(x)^2 - g(x)^2) dx$$

\subsubsection{Shell Method  - 5.3}
Integrates perpendicular to the axis of rotation. May be inconvenient if one lacks a curve function corresponding to these axes.

Based on a Riemann Sum of rectangular prisms $2 \pi rhw$ becoming
$$\lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{i=1}^{n} 2 \pi r(x_i) f(x_i) \Delta x_i$$

Shells can be "unwrapped" into a figure resembling a rectangular prism, with the difference in area approaching $0$ as $w = \Delta x \to 0$.

Let $f(x)$ be the function producing the curve underneath which the region $R$ is bounded by (with the other bounding sides being $x = a$, $x = b$, and $y = 0$). Let $r(x)$ be the function representing the distance ("radius") of the curve from the axis of rotation (usually $r(x) = b - x$, with $b$ potentially being $0$). In this case, we are revolving about the y-axis.

$$V = 2\pi \int_{a}^{b} r(x)f(x) dx$$

\subsubsection{Volume by Known Cross Section}
Let $A(x)$ be the area of the cross section.

$$V = \int_{a}^{b} A(x)dx$$

The Disk/Washer method is a special case of the volume by known cross section ($A(x) = 2\pi x^2$, circles).

\subsection{Arclength - 8.1}
The length of an arc. Defined as
$$ s = \int_{a}^{b} \sqrt{1+(f'(x))^2} dx$$

Based on using infinitely many line segments to approximate the length of an arc.
$S = \sqrt{(x_1-x_0)^2} + \sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2} + ... + \sqrt{(x_n-x_{n-1})^2}$ ($\sum_{i=1}^n \sqrt{(\Delta x_n)^2 + (\Delta y_n)^2}$)

For each term $\Delta s$, $\Delta s^2 = (\Delta x)^2 + (\Delta y)^2$.
Since  $\Delta y = f(x + \Delta x) - f(x) = \frac{f(x + \Delta x) - f(x)}{\Delta x}\Delta x$, $\Delta y = f'(x)\Delta x$.

\begin{align*}
    S & = \sum_{i=1}^n \sqrt{(\Delta x_n)^2 + (f'(x_n)\Delta x_n)^2} \\
      & = \sum_{i=1}^n \sqrt{(\Delta x_n)^2(1 + f'(x_n)^2)} \\
      & = \int \sqrt{dx^2(1 + f'(x)^2)} \\
      & = \int \sqrt{1 + (f'(x))^2} dx
\end{align*}

\subsubsection{The Three Forms of Arclength You can Do}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Lines
    \item Convenient u-sub polynomial
    \item Circles (requires arcsine)
    \item Calculator and cope
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Surface Areas of Revolution - 8.2}
Integrates using lateral surface areas of frustrums (difference between two right circular cones).

Letting $r_1$, $l_1$ be the radius and slant height of the smaller cone, $r_2$, $l_1 + l$ be the radius and slant height of the second cone:
$$A = \pi r_2(l_1 + l) - \pi r_1 l_1 = \pi[(r_2 - r_1)l_1 + r_2l]$$

Based on similar triangles,
$$\frac{l_1}{r_1} = \frac{l_1 + 1}{r_2}$$

so $r_2 l_1 = r_1 l_1 + r_1 l$, $r_1 l = (r_2 - r_1)l_1$, and letting $r = \frac{r_1 + r_2}{2}$

$$A = \pi (r_2 + r_1)l = 2 \pi r l$$

When we are integrating, $l$ is the arclength, and $r$ is the radius from the axis of rotation, likely $f(x) = y$ or $g(y) = x$.

Thus, for rotation about the x-axis:
$$S = \int_{a}^{b} 2 \pi f(x) \sqrt{1 + f'(x)^2} dx = \int_{a}^{b} 2 \pi y \sqrt{1 + g'(y)^2} dy$$

and for rotation about the y-axis:
$$S = \int_{a}^{b} 2 \pi x \sqrt{1 + f'(x)^2} dx = \int_{a}^{b} 2 \pi g(y) \sqrt{1 + g'(y)^2} dy$$


\section{Conic Sections}
Conic sections are obtained through slicing a cone. The different types of conic section have analogous properties.

\subsection{Parabola}

\subsubsection{Construction/Locus}
A parabola is the locus (of points in the plane) that is equidistant from a given point (focus) and a given line (directrix).
\begin{flushright}
    - The locus (set of points) definition of a parabola.
\end{flushright}

\subsubsection{Focus/Directrix}
For a parabola of focus point $F(a,b)$, directrix $y=k$:
$$\sqrt{(x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2} = |y-k|$$

\subsubsection{Analytic Properties}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $p$ is the focal length, the distance between the vertex of a parabola and its focus/directrix.
    \item The distance between focus and directrix is $2p$.
    \item In the special case that the focus is on the y-axis ($F(0, p)$), the directrix is $y = -p$, the equation of the parabola has the form $$x^2 = 4py$$ or $$y^2=4px$$
    
    One can use translations (as they are rigid motions) to orient a parabola into this form. This includes completing the square.

    \item A chord of a parabola is a line segment with two intersections with the parabola.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The focal chord is a chord that also spans through the focus.
            \item The Latus Rectum is the focal chord parallel to the directrix. The length is the focal width, $w = 4p$.
        \end{itemize}

    \item For a parabola $y=x^2$, a chord of endpoints $(a, a^2)$ and $(b, b^2)$ has a parallel tangent line at $(\frac{a+b}{2}, (\frac{a+b}{2})^2$.
    \item Perpendicular tangent lines on a parabola will intersect on the directrix.
    \item The y-intercept of a line tangent to $y=f(x)$ at $(a, a^2)$ has a y-intercept of $-a^2$.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Reflective Property}
The reflective property of the parabola is that the angle between a ray perpendicular to the directrix, and the tangent line at the intersection, is equal to the angle between the focus and that point of intersection. (All inbound rays will converge at the focus, useful for satellite dishes, all rays emitted from the focus will go in the same direction, useful for lights).

\subsection{Ellipse}
\subsubsection{Construction/Locus}
The locus of points where the sum of the two focal distances is a constant $2a$.

\paragraph{Fundamental Ellipse Equation (Focal Sum/Focal Width)}
$$F_1P + F_2P = 2a$$

\paragraph{Familiar Ellipse Equation}
$$\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$$
\\
Based on  $b^2x^2+a^2y^2=a^2b^2$ as derived from the Fundamental Ellipse Equation.

Note that $b^2 = a^2 - c^2$, $c^2=a^2-b^2$.

\subsubsection{Focus/Directrix}
The ratio of distance between a point to a focus $(0, c)$ of the ellipse, and the line $x = \frac{a^2}{c} = \frac{a}{e}$ is a constant:
$$\frac{\sqrt{(x-c)^2+y^2}}{|x-\frac{a}{e}|} = \frac{c}{a} = e < 1$$

The parabola is a special case of this equation with $e = 1$.

\subsubsection{Analytic Properties}
Expressions are provided for the special case of ellipses centered at $(0, 0)$ and with the x-axis as the major axis.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Foci: Points $F_1(-c, 0)$ and $F_2(c, 0)$
    \item Focal Radii: $\overline{F_1P}$, $\overline{F_2P}$
    \item Center: $(0, 0)$
    \item Vertices: $(-a, 0)$, $(a, 0)$
    \item Semi-Major Axis Length: $a$ ($a > b$, Major Axis is the wider one)
    \item Semi-Minor Axis Length: $b$
    \item Major Axis Length: $2a$ (see above)
    \item Eccentricity: $e = \frac{c}{a}$, $0 < e < 1$ (The eccentricity of an ellipse is always between $0$ and $1$.)

        As $e \to 0$, the ellipse figure approaches that of a circle.
    \item Area: $ab\pi = (\sqrt{ab})^2\pi$, (related to geometric mean of "principal radii")
    \item Circumference: No closed form exists
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Reflective Property}
The reflective property of an ellipse is that the angle between any rays emitted from one focus to the ellipse is equal to the angle between the ray-ellipse intersection and the second focus. (All emitted rays from a focus will dissipate, then reconverge at the second focus at the same time due to the constant focal sum.)

\subsection{Hyperbola}
\subsubsection{Construction/Locus}
The set of all points where the difference of the two focal distances is $2a$.

\paragraph{Fundamental Hyperbola Equation (Focal Difference)}
$$|\sqrt{(x-c)^2+y^2}-\sqrt{(x+c)^2+y^2})| = 2a$$

\paragraph{Familiar Hyperbola Equation}
$$\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$$

Here, $b^2 = c^2 - a^2$, $c^2 = a^2 + b^2$.

\subsubsection{Focus/Directrix}
The set of points in which the distance to a focus $F(\pm c, 0)$ and a line $x = \frac{a^2}{c} = \frac{a}{e}$ ($a < c$) is a constant ratio $\frac{c}{a} = e > 1$.

This is very similar to the focus/directrix construction of an ellipse, but now the line $x = \frac{a}{e}$ is between the foci.

$$\frac{\sqrt{(x-c)^2+y^2}}{|x-\frac{a}{e}|} = \frac{c}{a} = e > 1$$

\subsubsection{Analytic Properties}
Expressions are provided for the special case of ellipses centered at $(0, 0)$ and with the x-axis as the focal axis.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Foci: Points $F_1(-c, 0)$ and $F_2(c, 0)$
    \item Center: $(0, 0)$
    \item Vertices: $(-a, 0)$, $(a, 0)$
    \item Transverse Axis Length: $2a$
    
    The length of the line segment (distance) between the vertices.
    
    \item Conjugate Axis Length: $2b$
    
    The height of a rectangle bounded by the vertices, with diagonals being the asymptotes; technically this is the line segment centered at the origin, but it is alright to think of it as the side lengths.
    
    \item Eccentricity: $e = \frac{c}{a}$, $e > 1, a < c$
    \item Asymptotes: $y = \pm\frac{b}{a}x$

    Derived from $$\lim_{x \to \infty} \pm \frac{b}{a} \sqrt{x^2-a^2} = y$$ ($x^2 \gg a^2)$
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Reflective Property}
The reflective property of a hyperbola is that an exterior ray aimed at a focus $F_1$ will reflect off the portion of the hyperbola near $F_1$ towards the second focus $F_2$.

\subsection{Distance from a Point to a Line}
For a point $P(x_o, y_o)$, and a line given by $Ax + By + C = 0$

$$d = \frac{|C + Ax_o + By_o|}{\sqrt{A^2+B^2}}$$

This is on its own a generalization of the boolean question "is a point on a line?" to a qualitative "how much is this point not on the line?"

This can be generalized to any dimension.

\subsection{Transformations}
In general, transformations are two-variable functions that map planes onto other planes.

\subsubsection{u-v Substitution Method}
\paragraph{Translations}
For a translation $(x, y) \longrightarrow (x + a, y + b)$, one can transform the x-y plane into the u-v plane by letting
\begin{align*}
    u & = x + a  \\
    v & = y + b
\end{align*}

Then, we solve for $x$ and $y$, generating
\begin{align*}
    u - a & = x  \\
    v - b & = y
\end{align*}

So for any point $P(x,y)$, there is a translated point $P'(u-a,v-b)$, or if we relabel the variables to be more familiar, $P'(x-a,y-b)$.

In this case, $du = dx$ and $dv = dy$, representing how this is an isometry with perpendicular axes maintained.

\paragraph{Axial Scaling}
For a translation $(x, y) \longrightarrow (ax, by)$, one can find
\begin{align*}
    \frac{u}{a} & = x  \\
    \frac{v}{b} & = y
\end{align*}

Here, $du = adx$ and $dv = bdy$, this is not an isometry.

If we are to scale a circle in the x-y plane, we get
\begin{align*}
    x^2+y^2 & = 1 \\
    \left( \frac{x}{a} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{y}{b} \right)^2 & = 1
\end{align*}
or an ellipse.

\subsection{Rotations}
For a given point $P(x,y)$, let us find $P' = R_{O, \theta}(x,y)$.

We can rewrite $x$ and $y$ in terms of the trigonometric ratios of the right triangle formed between the point, the x-axis, and the origin.

Letting $r$ be the distance $PO$:
\begin{align*}
    x &= r \cos{\alpha} \\ 
    y &= r \sin{\alpha}
\end{align*}

Because rotation is about a circle centered about a point (in this case, $O(0,0)$), $PO = P'O = r$.
However, the angle has changed from $\alpha$ to $\alpha + \theta$.

Thus, the new coordinates are:
\begin{align*}
    u &= r \cos{\alpha + \theta} = r \cos{\alpha}\cos{\theta} - r \sin{\alpha}\sin{\theta} \\ 
    v &= r \sin{\alpha + \theta} = r \sin{\alpha}\cos{\theta} + r \cos{\alpha}\sin{\theta} \\
    u &= x \cos{\theta} - y \sin{\theta} \\
    v &= x \sin{\theta} + y \cos{\theta}
\end{align*}

If we are rotating a point, we can use these equations directly, with $(u,v)$ being the new image.

However to operate on an equation, we must solve for $x$ and $y$ based on these last two equations.

Making convenient substitutions of $u \cos{\theta}$ and $v \sin{\theta}$, or $u \sin{\theta}$ and $v \cos{\theta}$ will make it possible to resolve the system of equations.\footnote{Alternatively, one can rotate by $-\theta$ to invert the rotation operation.}

In the end, we find that a point $(x,y)$ rotated about the origin by angle $\theta$ has $x$ and $y$ coordinates
\begin{align*}
    x' =  x \cos{\theta} &+ y \sin{\theta} \\
    y' = -x \sin{\theta} &+ y \cos{\theta}
\end{align*}

Or in short, $(x,y) \longrightarrow (x \cos{\theta} + y \sin{\theta}, -x \sin{\theta} + y \cos{\theta})$.

Notice that the new coordinates $(x',y')$ are dependent upon both $x$ and $y$ terms from the original point, indicating an increase in complexity compared to translations and scaling.

\subsection{Unifying Principles}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Reflective Properties
    \item Focus-Directrix Properties
    \item Locus Definitions
    \item Eccentricity - related to the angle of the plane intersecting the cone, indicative of similarity
    \item Symmetry
    \item Conic Section - including degenerate hyperbola (double $abs(x)$) and degenerate ellipse (point) and degenerate parabola (tangent line)
    \item Construction from Dandelin Spheres
    \item Analytic Form
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{General Analytic Form of Conic Sections}
$$Ax^2 + By^2 + Cxy + Dx + Ey + F = 0$$

Assuming $C = 0$, so there is no cross-term induced rotation:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Circles show up when $A = B$, we simply complete the square and toss the remaining constant terms over to $r^2$.
    \item Ellipses show up when $AC > 0$ (same sign), $A \ne C$.
    \item Hyperbolas show up when $AC < 0$ (different sign).
    \item Parabolas show up with either $A = 0$ \emph{or} $B = 0$.
\end{itemize}

Assuming one of $A, B, C, D, E \ne 0$, it is possible to divide by that number to reveal an equivalent equation with only $5$ variables to solve for. Thus, it is possible to generate a general conic from $5$ points.

Circles can be solved for using $3$ points, and so can (vertical, assuming $B, C = 0$) parabolas.

There are three cases for the \emph{discriminant} of the general conic:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item If $C^2 - 4AB > 0$, the conic section is a hyperbola.
    \item If $C^2 - 4AB = 0$, the conic section is a parabola.
    \item If $C^2 - 4AB < 0$, the conic section is a ellipse.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Parametric}
\subsection{Parameterization}
A parameterization, which produces a parametric curve, defines a set of points $(x, y)$ as functions $(x(t), y(t))$.

A parameterization can be described as a function $r(t) = (x(t), y(t))$, a mapping of the $\mathbb{R}$ number line (the domain) onto a set of points (the range) in $\mathbb{R}^2$. This can also be considered a new coordinate system where the $t$ coordinates correspond to points on a curve rather than an axis.


\paragraph{Parameterization of a line}
Treating points $A$, $B$ as vectors (only addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication):
$$P(t) = (1-t)A + tB$$

If $0 \le t \le 1$, this is a functional definition of line segment AB, and if $t \in \mathbb{R}$, this is a functional definition of line AB.

\paragraph{Eliminating the Parameter}
Although it is possible to eliminate the parameter (solving for $t$ then substituting appropriately, this only produce a super-set ("universe") of the valid points in the parametric curve, for one loses the parameter indicating what points on the curve are valid and "when" (e.g. in particle motion problems).

\paragraph{Graphing a Parametric Curve}
To graph a parametric curve, it is helpful to think of intervals of note in the functions for $x$ and $y$, along with end behavior. Additionally, consider the range/domain of these functions to determine bounds for your parametric curve.

Orientation, in which \emph{direction} the points on the curve "move" as we increase/decrease $t$ (moving along the "number line"), is crucial to understanding a parametric curve. This is why direction must also be indicated in a parametric curve's graph.

\paragraph{Important Observation}
When viewed as a set of points, the graph of a relation has no unique parameterization.

There are infinitely many potential ways to parameterize a curve (as seen below in section \ref{param-examples}), so we may be able to pick and choose a convenient parameterization when needed.

\subsubsection{Common Examples of Parameterization} \label{param-examples}
\paragraph{Parameterization of the Unit Circle}
This is one of the most important parameterizations of a curve.
\[
    \begin{cases}
        x(t) = \cos t \\
        y(t) = \sin t
    \end{cases}
\]

It is possible to show that the set of points is included by the curve $x^2 + y^2 = 1$ by simply squaring, then adding, these expressions for $x$ and $y$.

This is also a restatement of the unit circle definition for $\sin$ and $\cos$ (replace $t$ with $\theta$).

If $x$ and $y$ are swapped, the same curve appears, but the direction becomes clockwise as opposed to counterclockwise, and the points will appear at different $t$ values.

The "speed" of the traversal of the curve can be scaled by putting a factor on t.

\subparagraph{Speed of a Parametric Curve}
For instance, to "double" the "angular velocity (speed) of the point" on circle parameterization:
\[
    \begin{cases}
        x(t) = \cos 2t \\
        y(t) = \sin 2t
    \end{cases}
\]

Refer to later sections to understand what this actually means.

Phase shifts can also be performed in a similar manner by substituting $(t+a)$.

\subparagraph{Scaling a Parametric Curve}
To scale a curve about an axis, simply multiply $x(t)$ or $y(t)$ by a scalar.

For instance, to parameterize an ellipse
$$\frac{x^2}{3^2} + \frac{y^2}{2^2} = 1$$

\[
    \begin{cases}
        x(t) = 3 \cos t \\
        y(t) = 2 \sin t
    \end{cases}
\]

\subparagraph{Translating a Parametric Curve}
To translate a curve $(a,b)$ units from $(0,0)$, simply add $a$ and $b$ to the corresponding functions.

For instance, a unit circle centered at $(a,b)$:

\[
    \begin{cases}
        x(t) = \cos t + a \\
        y(t) = \sin t + b
    \end{cases}
\]

\paragraph{Trivial Parameterization of $y=f(x)$}
For any curve $y = f(x)$:
\[
    \begin{cases}
        x(t) = t \\
        y(t) = f(t)
    \end{cases}
\]

\subsection{Derivatives of Parametric Curves}
Note that "the derivative" is not a meaningful term in this context due to the variety of possible derivatives to take.

\subsubsection{Tangent Lines ("First" and "Second" Derivative of the Curve)}
The slope of the tangent line is $\frac{dy}{dx}$, but we can only immediately derive $\frac{dx}{dt}$ and $\frac{dy}{dt}$.

Good news!
$$\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{\frac{dy}{dt}}{\frac{dx}{dt}}$$

Usually, if $\frac{dy}{dt} = 0$, the tangent line is horizontal, and if $\frac{dx}{dt} = 0$, the tangent line is vertical. However, if $\frac{dx}{dt} = \frac{dy}{dt} = 0$, there is an indeterminate form that may represent a cusp of the curve (the particle is momentarily "at rest", refer to the velocity section).

\paragraph{Axial Extrema}
Just like in our conception of $y=f(x)$, we can search for extreme y-values by looking for the zeroes of the function for the y-value, $y'(t)$, but we can also find the leftmost/rightmost points by leveraging $x'(t)$.

However, one must also consider end behavior ($t \to \infty)$, for absolute minima/maxima potentially do not exist on an unclosed interval.

\subsubsection{Concavity}
We keep notion of concavity as based on our traditional $y=f(x)$ functions, where the concavity is based on $\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}$.

Bad news! To calculate the second derivative of y with respect to x, you will be calculating
$$\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = \frac{d}{dx}\left[\frac{dy}{dx}\right] = \frac{\frac{d}{dt}\left[\frac{dy}{dx}\right]}{\frac{dx}{dt}}$$

\subsubsection{Arclength}
\begin{align*}
    S &= \int_{\alpha}^{\beta} \sqrt{\left(\frac{dx}{dt}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{dy}{dt}\right)^2} \,dt \\
    S &= \int_{\alpha}^{\beta} \sqrt{(x'(t))^2 + (y'(t))^2} \,dt
\end{align*}

This is the Riemann sum of the displacement between points on the curve.

Considering that this is a sum of velocity-time products, this arclength integral also represents the distance travelled by the particle from $t=\alpha$ to $t=\beta$.

\subsubsection{Speed}
The speed of a particle at a given moment is
\begin{align*}
    v &= \sqrt{\left(\frac{dx}{dt}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{dy}{dt}\right)^2} \\
    v &= \sqrt{(x'(t))^2 + (y'(t))^2}
\end{align*}
Notice that this is the magnitude (scalar, non-negative value) of the velocity vector (which has direction).

\subsubsection{Velocity}
The velocity vector is $<x'(t), y'(t)>$, and points in the direction of the tangent line when placed upon a point particle on the parametric curve.

For reference, the position vector is $<x(t), y(t)>$.

\subsubsection{Acceleration}
The acceleration vector is
$$<x''(t), y''(t)>$$

\subsubsection{Area "Under" a Parametric Curve}
$$A = \int_{\alpha}^{\beta} y(t) x'(t) \,dt$$

Notice that $x'(t) \,dt$ simply represents the (signed) $\Delta x$, with $x'(t)$ being a local multiplier.

\section{Polar Coordinates - 10.3 and 10.4}
The polar coordinate system uses coordinates of the form
$$(r, \theta)$$

With $r$ being the \emph{directed} distance from the designated pole point, and $\theta$ being the angle (in standard position) of that point.

The polar coordinate grid is drawn as a series of concentric circles (radius $r$) with straight lines (angle $\theta$) interspersed.

One way to conceptualize this coordinate system is placing a point on "which circle" (distance from pole), then how specifying far to rotate the point about the pole.

The pole is analogous to the origin in the Cartesian plane.

\subsection{Problems with the Polar Coordinate System}
There is no unique representation of points. This is in stark contrast to the Cartesian plane, in which each point has a unique coordinate label.

Coordinates are simply labels for points, and for any point given by the coordinates $(k, \alpha)$, the point can also be specified by any coordinate of the form $$(k, \alpha + (2n)\pi); n \in \mathbb{Z}$$.

Further, the point $(k, \alpha)$ can \emph{also} be specified by coordinates of form $$(-k, (2n+1)\pi); n \in \mathbb{Z}$$

Even worse, the pole point can be represented by \emph{any} coordinates $$(0, \theta); \theta \in \mathbb{R}$$.

\subsection{Conversions}
The crux of these conversions is \emph{Trigonometry}.

These conversions between coordinate systems can be thought of as functions mapping $\mathbb{R}^2 \mapsto \mathbb{R}^2$.

\subsubsection{Rectangular to Polar}
Remaining aware of domain restrictions on $\arctan$ (in which case the magnitude may need to be negated):

$$(x,y) \mapsto \left( \sqrt{x^2+y^2}, \arctan{\frac{y}{x}}\right)$$

More accurately, $r^2 = x^2 + y^2$.

\subsubsection{Polar to Rectangular}
$$(r, \theta) \mapsto (r \cos{\theta}, r \sin{\theta})$$
Noticing that polar is just a parameterization of $x$ and $y$ in terms of $r$ and $\theta$:
\begin{align*}
    x &= r \cos{\theta} \\
    y &= r \sin{\theta}
\end{align*}

In addition, $\tan{\theta} = \frac{y}{x}$.

\subsection{Common Polar Graphs}
\subsubsection{Circles}

\paragraph{Circles Centered at the Pole}
With $a$ being the radius of the circle (analogous to $x^2+y^2=a^2$):
$$r = a$$

\paragraph{Circles Through the Pole:}
\subparagraph{Diameter on the x-axis}
With $a$ being the \emph{diameter} of the circle (analogous to $\left(x - \frac{a}{2}\right)^2+y^2=\left(\frac{a}{2}\right)^2$):
$$r=a \cos{\theta}$$
\subparagraph{Diameter on the y-axis}
Similarly, a circle with diameter on the y-axis can be put in polar form as:
$$r=a \sin{\theta}$$
\subparagraph{Circle passing an Arbitrary Point}
For a circle that passes through the pole $(0,0$ and $(a,b)$:
$$r = a\sin{\theta} + b\cos{\theta}$$

\subsubsection{Lines}
\paragraph{Lines through the Pole}
$$\theta = \arctan{\frac{y}{x}}$$

\paragraph{Vertical Lines}
With $a$ being the value of the x-intercept (analogous to $x=a$, $a\ne0$):
$$r = a \sec{\theta}$$

\paragraph{Horizontal Lines}
With $a$ being the value of the y-intercept (analogous to $y=a$, $a\ne0$):
$$r = a \csc{\theta}$$

\subsubsection{Limaçon}
Polar curves of the form $r = c \pm \cos{\theta}$ or $r = c \pm \sin{\theta}$, where $c \ne 0$.

For $c > 1$, there is a dimple (slight bend inwards) on the x-axis (for $\cos$) or y-axis (for $\sin$).\\
For $c = 1$, there is a cusp hitting the pole from the x-axis (for $\cos$) or y-axis (for $\sin$). This is also known as a cardioid.\\
For $c < 1$, there is an inner loop.

\subsubsection{Roses}
Polar curves of the form $r=\cos{k\theta}$ (starts at $(0, 1)$) or $r=\sin{k\theta}$ (starts at $(0, 0)$, rotation by $\frac{3\pi}{2}$).\\
When $k$ is even, $2k$ petals appear on the curve, over a period of $2\pi$.\\
When $k$ is odd, $k$ petals appear on the curve, over a period of $\pi$, due to overlaps when $r < 0$ (antiperiodicity).

\subsubsection{Conics}
Conics with one focus at the pole with eccentricity $e$ and directrix at $x = \pm p$, $e,p > 0$ are described by the polar curve

$$r = \frac{ep}{1\pm e\cos{\theta}}$$

Replace $\cos$ with $\sin$ for vertical orientation.

Our notion of eccentricity applies just the same, $e=0$ makes a circle, $e=1$ makes a parabola, $e$ between makes an ellipse, and $e > 1$ makes a hyperbola.
\subsection{Polar and Derivatives}
Once again, "the derivative" is a meaningless term.

\subsubsection{Tangent Lines to Polar Curves} \label{polar-derivatives}
The slope of a tangent line is always $\frac{dy}{dx}$.

Because polar curves are simply a special case of parametric curves:
$$\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{\frac{dy}{d\theta}}{\frac{dx}{d\theta}}$$

For reference:
\begin{align*}
    \frac{dx}{d\theta} &= \frac{dr}{d\theta}\cos{\theta}-r\sin{\theta}\\
    \frac{dy}{d\theta} &= \frac{dr}{d\theta}\sin{\theta}+r\cos{\theta}
\end{align*}

To find critical values (for \emph{local} minima/maxima), one must solve for zero with these trigonometric expressions.\footnote{Cusps may occur, but the AP exam usually will not try to trick you with such quibbles.}

\subsubsection{Tangents to the Pole}
Tangent lines to the pole are represented by $\theta = s$, where $s$ is a solution for $r = 0$.

The angle at which the curve approaches the pole is also the angle of the tangent line.

\subsubsection{Polar Derivative}
The derivative of $r$ with respect to $\theta$, $\frac{dr}{d\theta}$ is the "polar derivative".

One common question asked on AP exams is what it would mean for $\frac{dr}{d\theta} < 0$, which is that $r \to -\infty$. If $r > 0$, this means that the curve is getting closer to the pole.

\subsection{Polar Area - 10.4}
Polar Area does NOT work like Cartesian area, as the simplest bounds (given angles $\theta$) do not easily correspond with unit squares.

Based on the area of a circle sector being $\frac{1}{2}r^2\theta$, if we use a Riemann Sum of small sectors to approximate the area of a polar curve, we find that
$$A = \int_{\alpha}^{\beta} \frac{1}{2} \left(f(\theta)\right)^2 d\theta$$

Here,  $r = f(\theta)$, and we assume that $f(\theta)$ is continuous and \emph{non-negative}.

It may also be helpful to leverage the symmetry of certain polar graphs to adjust the bounds such that $f(\theta)$ may remain positive, or to cancel out the coefficient of $\frac{1}{2}$.

\subsubsection{Area Between Polar Curves}
Unlike the area between Cartesian curves, in which we could simply take the vertical difference between the functions, we must graph the functions and split the area into "ice-cream cone" shaped polar area sections that we can integrate.

The boundaries of these sections are at the $\theta$ values where the graphs intersect. Do note that due to pole, $-r$, and $\theta$ cycling shenanigans, it is best to graph the curve first to get an accurate sense of where the intersections are (which may not always be "collisions" where $r$ and $\theta$ are equal).

\subsection{Polar Arclength}
This is an additional section in textbook section 10.4.

\vspace{.15in}
Based on $S = \int_{\alpha}^{\beta} \sqrt{\left(\frac{dx}{dt}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{dy}{dt}\right)^2} \,dt$, with $dt$ replaced with $d\theta$, and using the forms of $\frac{dx}{d\theta}$ and $\frac{dy}{d\theta}$ described in section \ref{polar-derivatives}, cancelling based on the Pythagorean Identity for $\sin$ and $\cos$:

$$L = \int_{\alpha}^{\beta} \sqrt{r^2 + \left(\frac{dr}{d\theta}\right)^2} \,d\theta$$


\section{Series}
\section{Differential Equations}

\section{Appendix}
\subsection{Important Theorem I}
If $f$ and $g$ agree everywhere, except possibly at $x=a$, then \[ \lim_{x \to a} f(x) = \lim_{x \to a} g(x) \]
assuming these limits exist.

\subsection{Area of an Equilateral Triangle}
Can be derived using the Pythagorean Theorem.
$$A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}s^2$$

\subsection{Surface Area of a Cone}
A (right circular) cone of radius $r$, slant height $l$, can be unwrapped into a sector of radius $l$ with an arc of length $2 \pi r$. Thus, $\theta = \frac{2\pi r}{l}$ ($S = \theta r$).
The area of this sector is
\begin{align*}
    A & = \frac{1}{2} l^2 \theta  \\
      & = \frac{1}{2}l^2\frac{2\pi r}{l}  \\
      & = \pi lr
\end{align*}


Thus, letting $l$ be the lateral length of the cone, $r$ be the radius of the cone's base,
$$SA = \pi rl$$

\subsection{Vector Magnitude}
For a 2-element vector $\Vec{c} = <a,b>$, the magnitude of $\Vec{c}$ is
$$c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$$

This is based on the Pythagorean Theorem/Distance Formula.
